<h2>The linux kernel</h2>
<p id="linux-kernel"> The Linux kernel is the main component in the Linux operating system. It is also the core communicator between a computerâ€™s hardware and its processes.
It exists within the OS and controls the major functions of the hardware of all computers, phones, laptops and servers. The kernel has 4 jobs memory management
which keeps track of the amount of memory used, what is being stored and where it is being stored. Process management which determines what processes are going to
use the CPU, when they are going to use the CPU and how long the CPU will be used. It acts as an interpreter for the hardware and processes. The kernel also receives 
service requests from the processes. If the kernel is properly implemented it will be invisible to the user, and it will work in its own world also known as "kernel space".
The kernel space is where the kernel stores all of its information and the information on your computer.

<h2>the mosaic browser</h2>
<p id="Mosaic-Browser"> Although the mosaic browser (aka NCSA Mosaic) wasn't the first browser or the first graphical web browser it is the browser credited with popularizing 
    the World Wide Web. It's clean and easily understood interface made the Web easily accessible to the general public. Marc Andreesen was a student in Computer Science and part-time assistant
    at the NCSA at the University of Illinois. This position allowed him to become rather familiar with the Internet and the World Wide Web. Although there were several web browsers at the time
    they were made for Unix machines with were quite expensive. This resulted in the Web only being used by engineers and academics.
