<h2>The linux kernel</h2>
<p id="linux-kernel"> The Linux kernel is the main component in the Linux operating system. It is also the core communicator between a computerâ€™s hardware and its processes.
It exists within the OS and controls the major functions of the hardware of all computers, phones, laptops and servers. The kernel has 4 jobs memory management
which keeps track of the amount of memory used, what is being stored and where it is being stored. Process management which determines what processes are going to
use the CPU, when they are going to use the CPU and how long the CPU will be used. It acts as an interpreter for the hardware and processes. The kernel also receives 
service requests from the processes. If the kernel is properly implemented it will be invisible to the user, and it will work in its own world also known as "kernel space".
The kernel space is where the kernel stores all of its information and the information on your computer.

<h2>the mosaic browser</h2>
<p id="Mosaic-Browser"> Although the mosaic browser (aka NCSA Mosaic) wasn't the first browser or the first graphical web browser it is the browser credited with popularizing 
    the World Wide Web. It's clean and easily understood interface made the Web easily accessible to the general public. Marc Andreesen was a student in Computer Science and part-time assistant
    at the NCSA at the University of Illinois. This position allowed him to become rather familiar with the Internet and the World Wide Web. Although there were several web browsers at the time
    they were made for UNIX machines with were quite expensive. This resulted in the Web only being used by engineers and academics. The browser weren't very user friendly either so Marc decided to develop
    a browser that would be easier to use and more graphically rich. Also in 1992  Andreesen recruited his colleague Eric Bina. The two would work tirelessly for days at a time they called their browser Mosaic.

<h2>the open source movement</h2>
<p id="Open-Source-Movement">The OSI was created as a software source code to help share and improve the use of the internet. In the 1990s the internet had been increasingly popular 
    as the Linux browser was being written about in Forbes and other media outlets, as well as the Netscape browser's source code was being released. The OSI was formed in 1998 as an "educational, advocacy and stewardship" organization.
    The "open source" name was created at a strategy session shortly after the release of the Netscape source code. The realization that the Netscape source code had received so much attention created an opportunity to 
    educate the people of open development code. In other words developer's believed that Netscape's source code would be a way to reach out to potential programmers. The researcher's believed it would be useful to label the software as free and needed a name therefore they came up with open source.

<h2>payPal</h2>
<p id="PayPal">In August 1998 Peter Thiel meets Max Levchin after Peter gave a speech at Stanford University on global market opportunities. Later in the year they come up with the ideas of digital wallets.
    In December of 1998 Peter and Max create PayPal however its original name is Confinity. In October of 1999 a company engineer develops an email-based payment method.
    However, in January 2000 Confinity's managers along with Max and Peter realize that end users are on the internet asking commercial partners and other buyers to sign up for Confinity 
    to foster quicker payments. Almost immediately after Confinity paves the way for eBay payments on the site. This gives Confinity a huge user base. Finally, in June 2001 the founders ditch the name Confinity, and give it the name PayPal.

<h2>eBay</h2>
<p id="eBay">In September of 1995 Pierre Omidyar launches AuctionWeb, a site which he describes as "dedicated to bringing together buyers and sellers in an honest and open marketplace."
    The first item founder Pierre listed on the site was a broken laser pointer which was purchased by Mark Fraser from Canada. In June of 1996 Chris Agarpao is hired as the first employee. (Chris is still an employee at eBay to this day.)
    By the end of June 1996 AuctionWeb has sold over $7.2 million worth of merchandise. In July pierre quit his day job and hired Jeff Skroll as President. In May of 1997 Beanie Babies become the craze and $500 million 
    worth of them are sold. In 1997 the millionth item is sold. Finally, in September of 1997 AuctionWeb is officially renamed as eBay.
